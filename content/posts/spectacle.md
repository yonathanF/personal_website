I've been reading Guy Debord's The Societcy of the Spectacle. It's a nice short read but incredibly dense because of how he writes (especially if you are used to more organized content compared to his aphorisms approach). I'm trying to collect some basic thoughts here. I don't think I have a clear thesis or even a consistent theme at the moment. 

Some interesting topics:
1. Cyclical time vs irreversible time

    1.1. pseudo-cyclical time

    1.2. history
2. Territory 
    
    2.1. vacations

    2.2. Work-life balance
4. The proletariat and the spectacle
