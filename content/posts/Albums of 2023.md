2023 was a great year for music! I really had a lot of fun listening to all these new albums this year and struggled a lot sorting them actually. Here is the list, ranked:

1. Sundial by Noname

   It was worth the wait. Deep reflections on the state of things through a leftist perspective yet she also looks within with each topic. Hold me down and gospel? and oblivion are probably my fav tracks.

2. Ways of Knowing by Navy Blue

   Consistently my top artist so no surprise here tbh. It's a sad album in many ways and Navy's story telling shines. Chosen, To Fall in Love, and Look in My Eyes are my fav tracks.

3. We Buy Diabetic Test Strips by Armand Hammer

   It's dense but playful and between those two you catch them drifting from thought to thought-- leaving you thinking too. Fav tracks: Y'all Can't Stand Right Here, The Gods Must Be Crazy, Niggardly, and Landlines.

4. Maps by billy woods/Kenny Segal

   I'm always blown away by how well he can connect dots and make it sound so effortless. You can hum along or think on it; he got you covered in either case. Fav tracks: Soft Landing, FaceTime, and Rapper Weed.


5. Beloved! Paradise! Jazz!? by McKinley Dixon

	This is a great jazzy album and equally great bars. This was my ideal album for my morning drives to work. Fav tracks: Sun, I Rise, Run Run Run, the album title! 

6. Lotus Glow by Adi Oasis

7. The Land is Inhospitable and So Are We by Mitski

8. Never Enough by Daniel Caesar

9. Scaring the Hoes by Danny Brown/JPEGMAFIA

10. Lahai by Sampha
