**Last Updated: December 2022** 

A lot of great music came out in 2022. Here are some of my favorites, ranked:

1. BLK VINTAGE --BLK ODYSSY [^1]

I have played FUNKENTOLOGY way too many times. HANG LOW is unreasonably smooth. MURDA is also nice af.

2. Sick! --Earl Sweatshirt

Lyrically impressive as always. 2010 has a nice flow with bleepy bloop beat and Tabula Rasa has a great feat. This is honestly a no skips album.


3. Mr. Morale and The Big Steppers --Kendrick

It's Kendrick. I will definitely be listening to this in 2023 too. I listened to N95, Die Hard, Father Time, and Silent Hill the most probably.

4. Give or Take --Giveon

Clingy, sad boy hours. For Tonight, Lie Again, dec 11th, and At Least We Tried are my favorites if I had to choose.

5. It's Almost Dry --Pusha T

Production was amazing and Pusha still amazing. Dreamin of The Past, Diet Coke, Call My Bluff, Hear Me Clearly were some of my favorites.

6. Aethiopes --Billy Woods

Amazing samples and bars. Asylum definitely caught my attention being an Ethiopian. Sauvage, Versailles, and Remorseless are also great.

7. Forest in the City --UMI

Beautiful voice and lyrics. It has an incredibly consistent feeling, idk how to describe it. I really like "say im ur luv", "moonlit room", and "wish that i could".


8. Hypnos --Ravyn Lenae

Each song feels kinda unique but still fits into the album feel. Really liked Cameo, MIA, Skin Tight, and 3D.

9. No Thank you  --Little Simz

Loved her last album and nothing less here. Would definitely be higher if I had more time to listen to it honestly. Angel, Gorilla, Broken, and X are nice.


10. Funk Wav Bounces Vol. 2 --Calvin Harris

So many amazing tracks in this album. Potion has an insane sexual energy. New To You, Ready or Not, Somebody Else, Day One, Stay With Me are also amazing.
